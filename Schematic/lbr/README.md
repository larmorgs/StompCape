Stomp Cape
=======

Greg Larmore and Matt Moravec

These are the additional libraries used in the Stomp Cape schematic.

The microbuilder.lbr library is courtesy of Adafruit

The bone.lbr library contains the rest of the necessary parts. The BeagleBone cape outline has been modified from that in Adafruit's microbuilder.lbr. Also the TC2030 symbol has been modified from tag-connect.lbr to reflect the correct pinout for the SPY-BI-TAG adapter.
