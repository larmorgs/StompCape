This is the repository for the Stomp Cape--a BeagleBone cape for an open source guitar effects stomp pedal. The pedal will leverage the power of 32-bit embedded linux on the BeagleBone and will be reconfigurable using node.js.

Current Status

Currently the schematic for the cape has been created and is being validated. Software to support the cape is under development.
