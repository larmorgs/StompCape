Stomp Cape

Greg Larmore and Matt Moravec


This is the repository for the Stomp Cape--a BeagleBone cape for open source guitar effects stomp pedal. The pedal will leverage the power of 32-bit embedded linux on the BeagleBone and will be reconfigurable using node.js. 


Current Status

Right now we are working on collecting footprints and creating the schematic for the cape. Also we have been ordering parts to create a breadboarded prototype to validate the schematic. Two EVMs have been ordered for the audio codec.
